# Emerging Technologies In Cyber Security C844

# Notes 
## Competency 4042.5.1 Cellular and Mobile Technologies
### Lession 1 Focus on Cellular Network Design, Frequency, Security Issues, and Business uses for Mobile and Smart Devices 
- PTSN Public Switched Telephone Network 
   - Wired communication channels brought phones into our homes, ran on it's own power network, worked during standard power outages. 
- Mobile phones use all the principles of two-way radio communications that have been around since the early 20th century. 
   - Making mobile phones subject to issues with range, power, signal-to-noise ratio, and interference. 
- Cellular design 
    Hexagonal (Six-sided) cells, leaving no gaps in coverage
- BTS Base Transceiver Station
    Communicates directly with the phone within its coverage aread
- BCS Base Controller Station 
   - Connects to the core network
   - Multiple Towers will connect to a BCS 
   - The core network connects all the BCS's together and to the PTSN and Internet
- Macrocells
   - Largest of cells used for rural areas 
- Microcells 
   -   used for smaller coverage areas, urban areas
- Picocells 
   - small hotspots that offer wi-fi connectivity via a mobile carrier, dense urban areas
- Limitation of frequency channels
    - First cellular system rolled out in the US had 830 usable channels 
    - 280 channels per cell 
- FDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access
    - FOundation of cellular coveage maps. each channel split further so multiple users can chare without interference 
- TDMA Time Division Multiple Access
    - Allows multiple users on the same frequency with it's own sliver of time. Works well in a voice converstaiton between two people, because "mostly silent"
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access 
    - Possible for several users to share multiple frequency bands at the same time. Spreads out the signal over the frequencies uses code to distinguish the connections 
    - 3G technology 
- Cellular handoff 
    - passes the signal back and forth between two cells at thier lowest strength 
- AMPS 1G 
    - Advance Mobile Phone system
    - deployed in 1993 for North America
    - Used analog signals to connect to cell towers
- GSM 
    - Global System for Mobile 
    - Responsible for SIM (Subscriber Idntity Module) card 
- CDMA 2G
    - Repsonsible for SMS (Short Message Service)
- GPRS / EDGE 
    - General Packet Radio Service 
    - Packet-switching technology
    - Brought websites to mobile devices
- 3G / HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access)
- 4G / LTE (Long Term Evolution)
- 5G 
    - Designed to meet the needs of the explosion of data traffic per user
### The BlackBerry Effect and the BYOD Revolution 
- RIM (Reseach in Motion)
- BES (Blackberry Enterprise Server) 
    - Brought about Push Email with MicroSoft Exchange allowing mobile users to send/receive email on the go as long as they had cellular coverage
    

### Lession 2 Identifies smartphone and tablet operating system security issues and architecture 
### Lession 3 Explore specific tops related to sandboxing, application provenance, emerging trends  
### Lession 4 Mobile Malware delivery techniques, major categories of mobile applications exploits, security implications for excessive application permissions requests, and the role the MDM plays in protecting compainies
