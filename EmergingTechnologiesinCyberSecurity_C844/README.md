# Emerging Technologies In Cyber Security C844

# Notes 
## Competency 4042.5.1 Cellular and Mobile Technologies
### Lession 1 Focus on Cellular Network Design, Frequency, Security Issues, and Business uses for Mobile and Smart Devices 
- PTSN Public Switched Telephone Network 
    Wired communication channels brought phones into our homes, ran on it's own power network, worked during standard power outages. 
- Mobile phones use all the principles of two-way radio communications that have been around since the early 20th century. 
    Making mobile phones subject to issues with range, power, signal-to-noise ratio, and interference. 
- Cellular design 
    Hexagonal (Six-sided) cells, leaving no gaps in coverage
- BTS Base Transceiver Station
    Communicates directly with the phone within its coverage aread
- BCS Base Controller Station 
   - Connects to the core network
   - Multiple Towers will connect to a BCS 
   - The core network connects all the BCS's together and to the PTSN and Internet
- Macrocells
   - Largest of cells used for rural areas 
- Microcells 
   -   used for smaller coverage areas, urban areas
- Picocells 
   - small hotspots that offer wi-fi connectivity via a mobile carrier, dense urban areas

### Lession 2 Identifies smartphone and tablet operating system security issues and architecture 
### Lession 3 Explore specific tops related to sandboxing, application provenance, emerging trends  
### Lession 4 Mobile Malware delivery techniques, major categories of mobile applications exploits, security implications for excessive application permissions requests, and the role the MDM plays in protecting compainies
