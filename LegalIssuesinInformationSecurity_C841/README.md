# Intro to C841 - Legal Issues in Information Security
Welcome to C841-Legal Issues in Information Security. I noticed that you started the course and wanted to provide some additional information and guidance. The lead Course Instructor has developed a great course plan to help our students with completing the course. See attached additional task guides, templates, and videos to help with your tasks. You should be able to complete the course in two weeks or less (see pacing help in the attached All-in-one guide). Follow the recommended approach outlined in the best practices section of the all-in-one guide!!!
 
# Overview:
Information security professionals have the role and responsibility for knowing and applying ethical and legal principles and processes that define specific needs and demands to assure data integrity within an organization. This course addresses the laws, regulations, authorities, and directives that inform the development of operational policies, best practices, and training to assure legal compliance and to minimize internal and external threats. Students analyze legal constraints and liability concerns that threaten information security within an organization.
Recommendations:
 
1. See what you know already:  The final for the course involves constructed work vice an exam. So, I recommend you first looking at the task requirements and case study and using that as your ‘preassessment’ of where you may need to focus reading in the text if needed. (i.e. If you have limited knowledge on CFAA and SOX,  you would want to spend some time reading up on CFAA and SOX within the text or online. If you know enough at this point, you can jump right in to working on the tasks.
 
2. Simply answer the questions: Approach section of parts A & B of each task as several individual questions (each rubric point) that you answer individually. Answer each section as if the other sections aren’t there even if you have to reiterate some similar points.
 
3. For Task 1, section A2:  You ARE allowed to use the three laws already present in the task, SOX, ECPA, and CFAA as your three laws in this section. I recommend you do.
 
4. Leverage my help docs, Walkthrough Video, and templates. Follow best practices and task guidance in the attached PDF, leverage one of the template options in the attached zip folder and leverage the below videos for speedy efficient completion of your tasks. Follow the recommended approach in the best practices section for help with what to read and when to read it.

If an evaluator identifies the work as exemplary, they may nominate an exceptional performance task submission that is passed on the first attempt with the highest available score on each aspect of the assessment and no articulation errors by stating why it was chosen.

Do I need to complete section C in a separate document from the document I use for sections A and B?
For task code IHP4, you will place responses to all three sections, A, B, and C in the same document. References to using a separate document for sections C is in reference to task code IHP1.
