# U.S. Laws Affecting Digital Forensics

There are many laws that affect digital forensics investigation. For example, some jurisdictions have passed laws that require the investigator to be either a law enforcement officer or a licensed private investigator to extract the evidence. Of course, that does not prevent a forensic investigator from working with information someone else extracted or extracting evidence if the information owner gave his or her permission. It is important to be aware of the legal requirements in the jurisdiction in which you work.

# - The Federal Privacy Act of 1974
The Privacy Act of 1974 establishes a code of information-handling practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by U.S. federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual.

# - The Privacy Protection Act of 1980
The Privacy Protection Act (PPA) of 1980 protects journalists from being required to turn over to law enforcement any work product and documentary materials, including sources, before it is disseminated to the public. Journalists who most need the protection of the PPA are those who are working on stories that are highly controversial or that describe criminal acts, because the information gathered may also be useful to law enforcement.

# - The Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994
The Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is a federal wiretap law for traditional wired telephony. It was expanded in 2004 to include wireless, voice over packets, and other forms of electronic communications, including signaling traffic and metadata.

# - Unlawful Access to Stored Communications: 18 U.S.C. § 2701
This act covers access to a facility through which electronic communication is provided or exceeding the access that was authorized. It is broadly written to apply to a range of offenses. Punishment can be up to 5 years in prison and fines for the first offense.
The actual wording of the statute is as follows:
Offense. —Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section whoever—intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided; or
intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility; and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
This law is used less frequently than the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. However, it is written broadly enough to cover a number of acts. Primarily, the focus is on any facility, server, or device used to store electronic communications. It is sometimes the case that when employees leave a company, they seek to take information that they can use in competition with the company. This can include emails or other stored communications.

# - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted in 1986, as an amendment to the first federal computer fraud law, to address hacking. Over the years, it has been amended several times, most recently in 2008, to cover a broad range of conduct far beyond its original intent.

# - The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 governs the privacy and disclosure, access, and interception of content and traffic data related to electronic communications.
The Computer Security Act of 1987
The Computer Security Act of 1987 was passed to improve the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems. The law requires the establishment of minimum acceptable security practices, creation of computer security plans, and training of system users or owners of facilities that house sensitive information.

# - The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) is a law that allows for collection of “foreign intelligence information” between foreign powers and agents of foreign powers using physical and electronic surveillance. A warrant is issued by the FISA court for actions under FISA.

# - The Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998
The Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998 requires service providers that become aware of the storage or transmission of child pornography to report it to law enforcement.

# - The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) protects children 13 years of age and under from the collection and use of their personal information by websites. It is noteworthy that COPPA replaces the Child Online Protection Act of 1988 (COPA), which was determined to be unconstitutional.

# - The Communications Decency Act of 1996
The Communications Decency Act of 1996 was designed to protect persons 18 years of age and under from downloading or viewing material considered indecent. This act has been subject to court cases that subsequently changed some definitions and penalties.

# - The Telecommunications Act of 1996
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 includes many provisions relative to the privacy and disclosure of information in motion through and across telephony and computer networks.

# - The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999
The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 allows for collection and use of “empty” communications, which means nonverbal and nontext communications, such as GPS information.

# - The USA PATRIOT Act
The USA PATRIOT Act is the primary law under which a wide variety of internet and communications information content and metadata is currently collected. Provisions exist within the PATRIOT Act to protect the identity and privacy of U.S. citizens.

# - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains many provisions about recordkeeping and destruction of electronic records relating to the management and operation of publicly held companies.
18 USC 1030 Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers
This is one of the most widely used laws in hacking cases. It covers a wide range of crimes involving illicit access of any computer.
18 USC 1020 Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Access Devices
This is closely related to 1030 but covers access devices (such as routers).

# - The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
This controversial law was enacted in 1998. It makes it a crime to publish methods or techniques to circumvent copyright protection. It is controversial because it has been used against legitimate researchers publishing research papers.

# - 18 USC § 1028A Identity Theft and Aggravated Identity Theft
As the name suggests, this law targets any crime related to identity theft. It is often applied in stolen credit card cases.

# - 18 USC § 2251 Sexual Exploitation of Children
This law covers a range of child exploitation crimes and is often seen in child pornography cases. Related to this rather broad law are several others, such as:

# - 18 U.S.C. § 2260: Production of sexually explicit depictions of a minor for importation into the United States

# - 18 U.S.C. § 2252: Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors (possession, distribution, and receipt of child pornography)

# - 18 U.S.C. § 2252A: Certain activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography

# - Warrants
According to the Supreme Court, a “seizure of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual’s possessory interests in that property” (United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 [1984]). The Court also characterized the interception of intangible communications as a seizure, in the case of Berger v. New York (388 U.S. 41, 59–60 [1967]). That means that law enforcement need not take property in order for it to be considered seizure; merely interfering with an individual’s access to his or her own property constitutes seizure. Berger v. New York extends that to communications. If law enforcement’s conduct does not violate a person’s “reasonable expectation of privacy,” then formally it does not constitute a Fourth Amendment “search” and no warrant is required. There have been many cases where the issue of reasonable expectation of privacy has been argued. To use an example that is quite clear, if you save a message in an electronic diary, you clearly have a reasonable expectation of privacy; however, if you post such a message on a public bulletin board, you can have no expectation of privacy. In less clear cases, a general rule is that courts have held that law enforcement officers are prohibited from accessing and viewing information stored in a computer if it would be prohibited from opening a closed container and examining its contents in the same situation.
Warrants are not needed when evidence is in plain sight. For example, if a detective is talking to someone about a string of burglaries in the neighborhood and can clearly see child pornography on that person’s computer screen, no warrant is needed. Another exception to the need for a warrant is consent. If someone who is authorized to provide consent (for example, the owner of a phone or computer) gives law enforcement that consent to a search, then no warrant is needed.
In computer crime cases, two consent issues arise particularly often. First, when does a search exceed the scope of consent? For example, when a person agrees to the search of a location, such as his or her apartment, does that consent authorize the retrieval of information stored in computers at the location? Second, who is the proper party to consent to a search? Can roommates, friends, and parents legally grant consent to a search of another person’s computer files? These are all critical questions that must be considered when searching a computer. In general, courts have held that only the actual owner of a property can grant consent, or someone who has legal guardianship of the owner. For example, a parent of a minor child can grant consent to search the child’s living quarters and computers. However, a roommate who shares rent can grant consent to search only shared living quarters and computers co-owned by both parties. A roommate cannot grant consent to search the private property of the other person.
There are other cases where investigators don’t need a warrant. One such circumstance is border crossing. Anyone going through customs in any country may have their belongings searched. This can include a complete forensic examination of laptops, cell phones, and other devices. Another such instance where a warrant is not needed is if there is imminent danger that evidence will be destroyed. In the case of the United States v. David, the court held that “When destruction of evidence is imminent a warrantless seizure of that evidence is justified if there is probable cause to believe that the item seized constitutes evidence of criminal activity.”
It is also important not to exceed the scope of a warrant. In United States v. Schlingloff, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157272 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 24, 2012), Judge Shadid held that use of Forensic Toolkit’s (FTK) Known File Filter (KFF) to alert on child pornography files was outside the scope of a warrant issued to look for evidence of identity theft. In this case, the owner of the device was suspected of identity theft, and a warrant was issued so that police could search for evidence of that crime. However, the investigator used the Known File Filter to search for child pornography, and indeed found illegal images on the computer in question.
