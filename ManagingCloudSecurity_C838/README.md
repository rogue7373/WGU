# Managing Cloud Security C838
# 4042.4.1 Secure Cloud Data Solutions
Secure cloud data solutions to safeguard data, personally indentifiable information, and information resources. 

## Lesson 1 - Architecture concepts, including foudational concepts of cloud computing, cloud evolution, definitions, and busiess requirements. 
### Cloud Characteristics
- Broad Network access
- On-deman self-service
- Resource poooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured or "metered" service

### NIST 800-146 Cloud Computing Definition
- The official NIST definitions of cloud computing says, "Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or servie provider interaction".

- Broad network access means services are consitently accessible by standar means, such as the suse of a web browser to access a Software as a Service (SaaS) application regardless of the user's location or choice of computer OS, browser, and so on. 
- On-demand self-service refers to the model that allows customers to scale their compute and/or storage needs with little or no inervention from or piror communication with the provider. The services happen in real time. 
- Resource pooling is the characteristic that allows the cloud provider to meet various demands from customers while remaining financially viable. The cloud provier can make capital investments that greatly exceed what any single customer could provide on their own and can apportion the resources as needed so that the resources are not under-utlized. 
- Rapid elasticity allows the customer to grow or shrink the IT footprint as necessary to meet operational needs without excess capacity. 
- Measured or metered service simply means that the customer is charged for only what they use and nothing more. This is much like how a water or power company charges.

### Business Requirements 
The IT department is not a profit center; it provides a support function. 
- A network security administrator has to know what type of traffic to expect based on the business of the organization. 
- The intrusion detection analyst has to understand what the organization is doing, how business activites occur, and where teh business is operating to better understand the nature and intensity of potential external attacks and how to adjust baselines accordingly. 
- The security architect has to undersand the various needs of hte organizational departments to enhance their operation without compromizing their security profile. 

### Functional Requirements 
Those performance aspects of a device, process, or employee that are necessary for the business task to be accomplished. Example: A salesperson in the field must be able to connect to the organizationâ€™s network remotely.

### Non-Functional Requirements
Those aspects of a device, process, or employee that are not necessary for accomplishing a business task but are desired to expected. Example: The salesperson's remote connection must be secure. 

## Existing State
A true evaluation and understanding of the business processes, assets, and requirements is essential. 
- Interviewing functinoal managers
- Interviewing users
- Interviewing senior management
- Surveying customers
- Collecting network traffic 
- Inventorying assets 
- Collecting financial records
- Collecting insurance records
- Collecting marketing data
- Collecting regulatory mandates

After sufficient data has been colelcted, a detailed analysis is necessary. This is the point where a business impact analysis (BIA) takes place. 

## Quantifying Benefits and Opportunity Cost
Once you have a clear picture of what your organization does in terms of the lines of business and processes, you can get a better undersstanding of what benefits the organization might derive from cloud migration as well as the costs associated with the move. 

#### Reduction in Capital Expenditure

If your organziation buys a device for use in its internal environment, teh capacity of that device will either be fully utilized or (more likely) not. If the device is used at its fullest capacity, the it's quite likely that the function for which it is needed may experience inefficiencies at some point. 
## Lesson 2 - Design requirements, including business requirements analysis, boundaries of cloud models, and design principles for protecting sensitive data.
